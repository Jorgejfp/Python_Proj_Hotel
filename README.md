# Project Python Languaje

• Basic python (operators, conditions, while loop, user interaction)
• Data structure (sequence, list, tuple, dictionary)

1- Create a program named divisor_python.py
  1. you should write a script that asks a user for a number. Then, print out if the number is even or odd
  2. and then it prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you don’t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number.
2- Create a file named list_python.py
  1. You should write a program that takes 5 names from user input and save them in a list
  2. Print out sorted names alphabetically in one line.
  3. Ask user to enter another name and add it to the list using built-in functions
  4. Print out names in reverse order(alphabetically)
  5. Take a name from user and check if that name is in the list using in operator. You should print out if name is in the list or not . For example:
     ********* Jane is not in the list **********
3- Create a file and named it data_structure.py
  1. Create a tuple named table_tuple which length is 4 by 4 including multiply table 1 to 4(fig-2) Important: Do not use any loop functions to create table of 4.
  2. Take 2 integer numbers from user. 1st value indicates item in raw and 2nd value indicates item in column.
  3. printout result from table_tuple using 2 integer values from input. Don’t forget that index in tuple starts from 0

  4. Print out whole table same as following image (you’d better to use concatenation, string format and 2 while loops)
  Tip: you can use \t for to separate numbers in each row

4- Create a file named students_dict.py
  - Write a script that takes values from user input and save them in a dictionary. This dictionary gets student number(integer) as a key and name as a value
  - The dictionary has 4 items which are students (you should use while loop to repeat previous step)
  - Printout all students. Look at following image
  - You must add every 2 students in a different program and print out the result (two programs needed are Science and Health). Look at following image.
  - Ask user to select option 1 or 2 as a number and then use that number to select one of the programs. Finally print out all 2 students belong to the program. Look at carefully to the following image.
