#There is a small local Inn near to the ocean named Pacific Inn that offers accommodation services to the customers. They need a reservation system to handle their business. You as 
# A developer is responsible to create a project based on Pacific Inn requirements.
# First, Pacific Inn has 4 types of rooms:
# 1- Standard rooms (S)
# 2- Premium rooms(P)
# 3- Ocean view rooms(O)
# 4- Economy rooms(E)
# Pacific has 1 Standard rooms, 5 Premium rooms,9 Economy rooms and 5 Ocean view ones.
# In this project you have number of costumers with their desire accommodation information that you need to make a reservation and complete check-in/out for Pacific Inn
# This project has following main functionalities
# 1- Some costumers make their reservation by phone and a receptionist saved customer request in a text file. So, the project must reserve room by reading a reservation information from a given file and save records in a database named Inn_reservation
# 2- When a customer wants to Check-out then LIRS must print out the customer accommodation information and free his/her room in the system.
# 3- It should have a mechanism to Check-in new customer with interactive question from console and save a new reservation in its database.
# 4- If all rooms are full, check-in process must be locked as if the user is not able to choose check-in option.
# In the next point you will see the schema of LIRS database that you will implement with MySql db.

# Inn_rooms table stores all room information.

# Inn_reservation is the most important table.
# It has relationships with 2 other tables.
# room_type and costumer_id are foreign keys
# In inn_reservation table.
# checkout data type in inn_reservation is tinyint that gets
# either 0 or 1 values.
# If value is 0 means the costumer has not been checked-out
# and he/she needs to pay for the service.
# If Value is 1 means the costumer has been successfully
# checked-out and he/she already paid for all services.
# Look at next page to see some records in each table.
